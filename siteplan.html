        <p>Dry Oar River Rafting - A historical river adventure.</p>
      </section>

        <h3>Site Purpose</h3>
        <p>
          The primary purpose of the website is to sell river rafting trips. The
          secondary purpose is informing visitors about the joys of rafting
          adventures and the histories of the rivers we offer rafting trips on.
          I want to create a company that uses the river rafting trip as a way
          to connect to the history of an area rather then just another trip.
          While everything in the website will be pulling the consumer to the
          'book an adventure' page, the focus will seem to be on giving the
          consumer information on rafting, the history of the river, and the
          experiences of the natives of the land.
