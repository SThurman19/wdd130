        <h2>Daily's Mission</h2>
        <p>We want to revolutionize social media platforms as you know it. The mission is to remove cheap meaningless posts about lunch at a random cafe or a courtesy happy brithdays from the clutter of your life. By limiting posting to a once-a-day commodity you can be sure you are only seeing the most important parts of your freinds' day. Additionally, the fact that each post will only exist for a maximum of 48 hours, showing support for the people you follow will be significantly more obvious then being the person who likes a post from 5 years ago.</p>

        <h2>How Does Daily Work?</h2>
        <p>Your posting will be limited to one per day, aka, your Daily Post. You will then be able to see everyone else's Daily Post from today and yesterday in your feed. Add new freinds to see more content, like their posts to show your support, and reply to their polls. After 2 days, each post will disappear. But don't worry, if there a post from your freind that you love you can save it. Because posting is a limited resource, every Daily Post will be better thought out and more sincere!</p>
